# Code Review Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### [P1] Avoid resetting after failed disconnect
**Location**: `src/contexts/ClientContext.tsx:235-266`

**Problem**: 
Previously, if `client.disconnect()` threw an error, we would still execute `reset()` in the finally block. This wiped out local session state even though the WalletConnect session remained active, leaving the dapp out of sync and preventing subsequent retry attempts.

**Solution**:
Restructured the `disconnect()` function to only call `reset()` when:
1. Disconnect succeeds
2. There was no session to begin with  
3. Client was never initialized

The function now throws the error after logging/toasting, allowing callers to handle failures appropriately while preserving session state for retry attempts.

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
const disconnect = useCallback(async () => {
  if (typeof client === "undefined") {
    console.error("WalletConnect client not initialized");
    toast.error("WalletConnect client not initialized", { 
      position: "bottom-left" 
    });
    reset(); // Still reset local state if client never initialized
    return;
  }
  
  // If no session, just reset and return
  if (!session) {
    reset();
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    await client.disconnect({
      topic: session.topic,
      reason: getSdkError("USER_DISCONNECTED"),
    });
    // Only reset if disconnect succeeds
    reset();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Disconnect error:", error);
    toast.error(`Failed to disconnect: ${(error as Error).message}`, {
      position: "bottom-left",
    });
    // Don't reset on error - session is still active, allow retry
    throw error;
  }
}, [client, session]);
```

### [P2] Reset fetching flag on abort
**Location**: `src/contexts/ClientContext.tsx:94-104, 141-144`

**Problem**:
When aborting an in-flight balance fetch (e.g., via `reset()` during disconnect), the finally block was skipping `setIsFetchingBalances(false)` because `signal.aborted` was true. This left the context stuck in a perpetual `isFetchingBalances === true` state, causing consumers like `Blockchain` to show spinners indefinitely.

**Solution**:
1. Added `setIsFetchingBalances(false)` to the `reset()` function
2. Removed the condition in the finally block of `getAccountBalances()` to always clear the flag

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
const reset = () => {
  // Abort any in-flight balance fetches
  abortControllerRef.current?.abort();
  abortControllerRef.current = null;
  setSession(undefined);
  setBalances({});
  setAccounts([]);
  setChains([]);
  setRelayerRegion(DEFAULT_RELAY_URL!);
  setIsFetchingBalances(false); // Clear loading state on reset
};

// In getAccountBalances():
} finally {
  // Always clear loading state, even on abort
  setIsFetchingBalances(false);
}
```

## Impact

### P1 Benefits:
- ✅ Session state remains synchronized with WalletConnect client
- ✅ Users can retry failed disconnect attempts
- ✅ No unexpected state wipes on network/client errors
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback

### P2 Benefits:
- ✅ No stuck loading spinners
- ✅ UI accurately reflects loading state
- ✅ Clean state on disconnect/abort
- ✅ Better user experience

## Testing

Both fixes should be tested with:
1. Network disconnection during disconnect attempt
2. Rapid connect/disconnect cycles
3. Disconnect during active balance fetching
4. Retry after failed disconnect attempt
5. Force-close wallet during disconnect

All scenarios should now properly handle state transitions without leaving the app in an inconsistent state.
