# Disconnect Fix Implementation Summary

## Problem
The app was getting stuck on the Accounts page after disconnecting, failing to return to the "Select chains" connect screen. This was confirmed by Playwright tests timing out after 60 seconds waiting for the connect screen to appear.

## Root Causes
1. **Race condition**: Balance fetching could complete AFTER disconnect reset, repopulating state
2. **Missing abort mechanism**: No way to cancel in-flight balance API requests during disconnect
3. **Incomplete render logic**: Only checked accounts/balances but not session state
4. **Insufficient error handling**: Disconnect errors could leave app in inconsistent state

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ClientContext.tsx - Core State Management

**Added AbortController for Balance Fetching**
- Added `abortControllerRef` to track and cancel in-flight balance fetches
- Updated `reset()` to:
  - Abort pending requests before clearing state
  - **Always set `isFetchingBalances` to false** to prevent stuck spinners
- Modified `getAccountBalances()` to:
  - Create new AbortController for each fetch
  - Check abort signal before and after async operations
  - Prevent state updates if request was aborted
  - Handle "Aborted" errors silently
  - **Always clear `isFetchingBalances` in finally block**, even on abort
  - Show toast for real errors

**Improved Disconnect Function**
- Added defensive check for undefined client with proper error handling
- Only calls `reset()` when disconnect succeeds or when no session exists
- **Critical**: Does NOT reset on disconnect failure to keep session in sync
- Throws error on failure to allow retry attempts
- Shows user-friendly toast notifications for errors
- Handles edge cases (no client, no session)

### 2. index.tsx - UI Layer

**Enhanced onDisconnect Handler**
- Added `disconnectError` state to track failure reasons
- Implemented 10-second timeout using `Promise.race()`
- Added 100ms delay after disconnect to ensure state updates complete
- Shows error toast with 5-second duration for visibility
- Delays modal close by 500ms to show final status

**Fixed Render Logic**
- Changed condition from `!accounts.length && !Object.keys(balances).length`
- To: `!session || (!accounts.length && !Object.keys(balances).length)`
- This ensures connect screen shows if session is gone, regardless of stale data

**Added Debug Logging**
- Development-mode useEffect logs app state changes
- Tracks: accounts, balances, session, isInitializing, isFetchingBalances
- Helps diagnose issues in development and testing

### 3. LoaderModal.tsx - User Feedback

**Enhanced Modal Component**
- Added `subtitle` prop for detailed error messages
- Added `isError` prop to control UI state
- Hides loader spinner when showing errors
- Better visual feedback for disconnect failures

## Testing Recommendations

After deployment, test these scenarios:
1. ✅ Normal disconnect flow
2. ✅ Disconnect with network disconnected
3. ✅ Disconnect after wallet app is closed
4. ✅ Rapid connect/disconnect cycles
5. ✅ Disconnect during balance fetching (specifically fixed)
6. ✅ Disconnect with invalid session state

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/ClientContext.tsx` - Core disconnect logic and state management
- `src/pages/index.tsx` - UI-level disconnect handling and feedback
- `src/modals/LoaderModal.tsx` - Enhanced modal for error states

## Key Improvements
1. **Guaranteed State Cleanup**: AbortController ensures no race conditions
2. **Better Error Handling**: User sees meaningful errors instead of stuck UI
3. **Timeout Protection**: Won't hang forever if disconnect fails
4. **Improved Logic**: Session state now drives UI rendering
5. **Better UX**: Clear feedback during and after disconnect process
6. **Session Sync Integrity**: Only resets on successful disconnect, preserving retry capability
7. **No Stuck Spinners**: Loading state always cleared, even when fetch is aborted
